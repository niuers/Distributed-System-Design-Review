# Overview
1. We assume that anything that can go wrong will go wrong except that faults are non-Byzantine.

# Faults and Partial Failures
## Cloud Computing and Supercomputing

# Unreliable Networks
## Network Faults in Practice
## Detecting Faults
## Timeouts and Unbounded Delays
## Synchronous Versus Asynchronous Networks

# Unreliable Clocks
## Monotonic Versus Time-of-Day Clocks
## Clock Synchronization and Accuracy
## Relying on Synchronized Clocks
## Process Pauses

# Knowledge, Truth and Lies
## The Truth is defined by the majority
## Byzantine Faults
## System Model and Reality
