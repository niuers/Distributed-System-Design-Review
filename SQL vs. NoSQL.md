# Comparision of SQL and NoSQL

## SQL
1. If you denormalize your data and include no more Joins in any database query, You can stay with MySQL, and use it like a NoSQL database.
2. Scale Out RDBMS
   * Sharding
      * Partitioninig
      * Replication
3. Anti-Pattern: ORM (Objectâ€“relational mapping) + Rich Domain Model
   * One attempts to read an object from DB, but results with whole database 
4. Think about Your Data, Think again!
   * When do you need ACID
   * When is evental consistency a better fit?
   * Different kinds of data have different needs?

5. When RDBMS is not Good Enough
   * Scaling reads to a RDBMS is hard
   * Scaling writes to a RDBMS is impossible

### Denormalization
### SQL Tuning

## NoSQL
MongoDB or CouchDB
1. Joins will now need to be done in your application code.


Need use cache to improve the performance.
