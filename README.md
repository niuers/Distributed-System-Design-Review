# Key Characteristics of Distributed Systems
## 1. Reliability
### Definition: 
The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity (hardware or software **faults**, and even human error)
1. In simple terms, a distributed system is considered reliable if it keeps delivering its services even when one or several of its software or hardware components fail.
2. **Fault-Tolerant or Resilient Systems**: The systems anticipate (certain types of ) faults and can cope with them.

### Examples
1. AMAZON: A purchase shouldn't be cancelled due to the failure of the machine which runs the transaction.

### Faults
#### Software Faults
#### Hardware Faults
#### Human Error
